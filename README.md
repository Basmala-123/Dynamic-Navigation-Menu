# Landing Page Project
This project is an example of how DOM can be manipulated through the use of JavaScript.

## Getting Started
Index.html file is where all the changes are visually reflected. 
To see the code, please open index.html for HTML, app.js for JavaScript, styles.css for CSS code.

### Instructions
1. The navigation menu is dynamically build. In testing, one more sections was added to check if the navigation menu expands automatically. 
2. The navigation menu contains links to the correspondent sections of the landing page.
3. A click on a section in the navigation bar triggers soft scroll to anchor ID using scrollTO event. 
4. A section that is in the viewport is highlighted by a different color and animation.
